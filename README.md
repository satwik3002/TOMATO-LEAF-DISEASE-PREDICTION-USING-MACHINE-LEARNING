# TOMATO-LEAF-DISEASE-PREDICTION-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Tomato leaf diseases can be caused by various factors such as fungal, bacterial, or viral infections, as well as environmental stress or nutrient deficiencies. Early detection and diagnosis of tomato leaf diseases are critical to preventing the spread of the disease and minimizing crop losses.
Overall, machine learning-based approaches have shown promising results for tomato leaf disease detection and can potentially improve the efficiency and accuracy of disease diagnosis in tomato crops.
